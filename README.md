This is a fork of RealWorld example app in Dotnet. This have been instrumented with metalama to detect energy hotspots using our tool Thor.
The original README:

# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Dotnet 7] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Dotnet 7]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Dotnet 7]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

Conversion of [Clean Architecture setup using Dotnet](https://github.com/Erikvdv/realworlddotnet) 
into a version using Minimal API's
The solution now does not have a direct dependency with dotnet mvc anymore

Consisting of the following layers:
- api 
- data
- infrastructure


Build using the following features:
- Minimal api's (Using Carter Modules for code structuring)
- the new WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)
- file scoped namespaces
- Entity Framework Core with SQLite db
- serilog for logging 
- logging integrated with application insights, including realtime monitoring
- Hellang.Middleware.ProblemDetails for consistent error output
- sonarlint for code scanning

# Getting started

This solution uses an in memory SQLite db. In case you want to use a file based db
then you can add migrations as indicated below 

## migrations
Add migration by going to Data folder and execute:
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName --startup-project ../Api/Api.csproj

Run db upgrade:
dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../Api/Api.csproj
